This is the first ever YouTube video I have ever watched which means that it is the first time I have an account to create videos and more on YouTube. Anyways, I just wanted to say that I love this YouTube video. I know that this woman singing is Taylor Swift. I love her music video! I would 100% watch her music videos. I know that is music is trying to tell us that if you’re doing a type of sport and you’re nervous, “Shake It Off”. This is the perfect music video for anti-stressing.

I DO NOT want my Children raised &quot;ghetto kids&quot;. They have to be raised Nigerian and non-ghetto American.<br><br> There is Nigerian Culture, Ethiopian Culture, Kenyan Culture, Jamaican Culture, etc  and so on, we are NOT sexually &quot;loose&quot; like Black Americans ( having sex like street prostitutes).<br><br> They (  Black Americans) DO NOT have &quot;basic courtesy&quot;. They have seen that I want to have Children with you ( Taylor ), NOW they will ostensibly come and say &quot; Oh I want to help you perform, come to our party ........ &quot; deceptively gaining access to you and then trying to get sexual gratification by &quot;Hugging you&quot;. Look at what they did in Staples Center last year during your 1989 World Tour by bringing the Basket Ball Player and Houston Texas, bringing a &quot;Street Rapper&quot; as  Guests without having the &quot;courtesy&quot; to ask if it is fine with your BoyFriend. <br><br>They will NOT do that with Will Smith&#39;s Wife ( Jada Pinkett Smith) or Lionel Ritchie&#39;s Wife or Tim McGraw&#39;s Wife ( Faith Hill ) or even Beyonce Knowles because they know what will happen. (Big Fight ).<br><br>So Gwen Stefani is #1. She is GOOD with &quot;Brains&quot; like Cher, Madonna, Shakira, Britney, Mandy Moore, Kylie Minogue, Heidi Kloum, Julia Roberts, Eva Logoria. .
