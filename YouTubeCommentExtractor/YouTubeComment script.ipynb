It was an RP server I believe. In front of that was a road leading both side directions. To the left (facing away from the school) was a pet shop and I believe a Starbucks? To the right was a giant rollercoaster and a series of houses we all built together. I also remember an artificial forest with different colored tents and balloons (Education Edition was on). I also remember placing down every element off the periodic table in order for some reason. <br>I remember you told me that the other person that was always on was your sister that joined from the LAN, I remember asking if that was the case of if she joined from Multiplayer PE. <br>I remember that one day where us and a couple of other people were playing a kind of truth or dare thing, and lightning kept striking random people (that was me doing that lol, it was fun). I remember we did that on top of our house, I think we had a dog, can‚Äôt remember it‚Äôs name. I think I installed a door bell, and maybe my signature Command Block 3x3 ‚Äúsliding‚Äù glass door somewhere. I remember making a neat inescapable trap with command blocks for some reason. <br>I remember in this RP thing we were dating or something?
