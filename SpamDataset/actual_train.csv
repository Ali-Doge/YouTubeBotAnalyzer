The reason why the Qing Dynasty army is in Korea is because Korea asked for help from the Qing Dynasty. At that time, Korea was corrupt. Therefore, the Donghak Peasant Movement took place, saying that civilians could no longer tolerate corruption and drove out the corrupt imperial family. So Korea tried to send troops to suppress them, but they lost to Donghak Peasant Army. So Korea asked the Qing Dynasty for help. However, Japan suddenly entered Korean land without permission and occupied Seoul. Since then, Japan has attacked the returning Qing army, and the Sino-Japanese War broke out on the Korean Peninsula.","OverSimplified's ""WW2"" series offers an entertaining and educational take on World War II.

Ugw-oMvb9b08FNTCHnp4AaABAg,@aforandi,2022-02-04T03:48:12Z,"Russia or the Soviet Union lost its Great War. Italy was badly stuffed in combat and had to be propped up by its allies. The French army mutinied in 1917. America won its war in France, in a manner of speaking, given the highly incompetent Pershing and 100,000 deserters in the rear areas. Austro-Hungary didn‚Äôt so much lose as cease to exist. Turkey was attacked from all sides and despite every imaginably national disadvantage put up its usual superlative exhibition of hard fighting that stopped all its enemies, greatly to the pride of the nation. After the Armistice fighting continued everywhere except France. For the Germans, the reasons why they had lost were not apparent [they were in excellent shape in November 1918 [eg. a bumper harvest, a dominant air force], so blame had to be assigned somewhere.<br><br><br>Hitler was 5 foot 10 [180cm]. He was increasingly happy with his political success. He was rather a weak megalomaniac who struggled to impose his will, sometimes threatening people with jail time, whilst in the Soviet Union Stalin shot 20,000 people a day.<br><br>‚ÄòRacist‚Äô is probably wrong [its a slang term anyway, used in this manner], for example in North Africa the Axis got on with the Muslim natives much better than the British. The Nazis were in fact racialist, believing that one race, their Nordic one, was more advanced than others. Hitler‚Äôs only motivation was to set up a thousand-year Reich, hopefully utopian, which would emulate in Russia what the British had achieved in India, where 40,000 whites ruled 500 million natives. His favourite film, ‚ÄòLives of a Bengal Lancer‚Äô, reinforced this desire. ‚ÄòAnti-socialist‚Äô is kinda odd too: the gigantic Nazi holiday camp complex at Prora on Ruegen island would seem to emphasize socialist communality on a massive Nazi scale.<br><br>Germany and Russia were friendly between the wars as they were both members of the Great War loser‚Äôs club. China can be added here, as they were in theory Great War winners who were treated as losers by the actual winners due to perceived racial &amp; national inferiority.<br><br><br>When Hitler came to power, he had no military aircraft or tanks,. and seven years later the German army and air force defeated supposedly strongest army in the world, the French, in hours rather than days. Nazi ‚Äòworld philosophy‚Äô did not demand taking over the world. Germany was not a great power as it lacked a fleet. Their limits were India, which they hoped would continue to give the British major problems, and the Ural mountains, beyond which a Judaeo-Bolshevik state would devolve into barbarism, so proving Nazi philosophy correct. The Nazis were always aware there were only 90 million Germans. Hitler stated he had no interest in North Africa [this may have changed had he known about the oil &amp; gas], and that he had only limited interest in overseas [tropical] possessions.<br><br><br>Appeasement has its problems, as Germany was not appeased with the countries they valued most, like Romania and Bulgaria, because the British valued them too. Hitler was Austrian so Austria hardly counts. Czechoslovakia was somewhat pro-Nazi to begin with, and as ‚Äòa small country far away‚Äô the British clearly didn‚Äôt care about it either.<br><br><br>Nanking was prompted to a degree by the realisation that Japan could not prevail against the Chinese because they were too numerous. Hence they needed biological or atomic weapons, so Special Unit 731 was set up.<br><br><br>Poland: this segment is generally wrong, and I suggest it sounds confused. Britain had pursued a war policy toward Germany because of their mutual desire to control the SE European countries, ie. those NOT used for appeasement. To defeat the German, they had to be engaged on two fronts, so Poland, Romania and other countries were approached with a defensive guarantee. Poland accepted in March 1939. Poland decided to fight rather than acceded to German demands, and this gave Britain its war with Germany, though it also dragged in a reluctant France and placed the Soviet Union on the other side as second-class Nazis. In this way Britain began a second world war. Germany was surprised by Britain‚Äôs declaration of war not least because Poland‚Äôs government was a brutal dictatorship that had always killed its own citizens in small numbers [eg. Jews], whereas Czechoslovakia had been a sunrise democracy. The Phony War was promoted by an especially hard winter in 39-40, but also it suggests something odd about British policy toward Germany. Here it may help to understand that policies up to 1939 were not influenced by events 1940-45, though they are often portrayed as if they were.<br><br><br>Both sides were scared of the other controlling Norway. The Germans had air supremacy, rather than superiority. The British army is defeated by the Germans for the first time. <br>Why did Churchill have a different attitude toward the Germans? Clearly he had had it for many years by 1940.<br><br><br>The idea of a ‚ÄòFrance first, Russia second‚Äô plan is I think completely wrong. The decision to invade the Soviet Union was extremely complex and post-dated the fall of France. The blitzkrieg in France was not planned [the Russian one was], but was implemented day-to-day by progressive panzer generals such as Guderian and Manstein, in this way controlling the battle on the German side. Hitler issued the ‚ÄòStop‚Äô order outside Dunkirk to regain control of his forces ‚Äì again this is a commentary on his weakness as a leader, which goes against the megalomania nonsense, and this at a time when his forces were winning both easily and most unexpectedly. In fact a smaller number panzer divisions, of the ten in total, went through the Ardennes.<br><br><br>The British have been defeated a second time by the Germans. Why should they not make peace? Britain was all alone, with only the entire British empire, American wealth, lots of allies and a number of anti-Soviets and anti-nazis to help them, not to mention an enormous fleet.<br><br><br>American and British relations with Vichy France were particularly perplexed, not least because Vichy and other French entities were mainly in conflict with each other, whilst the side the French people supported most was the French one. Few officers followed the traitor De Gaulle to London, but many volunteered to fight the Soviets with the German army. The Nazis had swept away many enemies of right-wing Frenchmen so their victory wasn‚Äôt seen by them as an entirely bad thing.<br><br><br>The Luftwaffe fought the Battle of Britain to bring the British to peace talks. In 1940 they had little involvement with or ability to influence an Army-Navy invasion plan. Their abilities in naval combat were negligible, and indeed they had no interest in these matters.<br><br><br>It could be mentioned that Churchill was upset that no German bomb fell on a British city for a long time whilst Bomber Command tried and largely failed to carry out its pre-war strategy of winning a war by bombing German cities.","OverSimplified's ""WW2"" series offers an entertaining and educational take on World War II.

Ugy_TsTpZarT4uAyq7B4AaABAg,@eddyvonschnitzler7918,2022-06-06T07:29:53Z,"Many states did not want to admit that Germany is the land of poets, thinkers, musicians and inventors and that is why the English empire at the time was full of envy and hatred.  It was unacceptable that Germany was already industrially superior in Europe during its imperial period and that the English empire was losing face.  The English sterling silver also lost value, etc. Therefore, plans were made to bring the German Empire to its knees.  But the strengthened Germany could never have been defeated militarily alone.  You saw it in 1870, when France under Napoleon III declared war on us and the German Reich humiliated France with a blitzkrieg in less than 12 months.  Now our sister state France also hated us, although many years earlier Napoleon had devastated Germany and all of Europe.  Envy and lust for power can be so bad that England forgot they came from the German Anglo-Saxons and France from the German Franks, among others.  The Allied plan worked and the First World War began in 1914.  Today, even foreign historians say that Germany did not start the war alone, but the US intervened in 1917 because they feared that England and France would lose the war and that both countries would not repay their enormous debts to the US afterwards.  After losing the war, Germany was forced to accept sole guilt and pay such high reparations that it could never get up again.  The Allies also stole about 2500 patents (inventions) from us.  That shows the disgust of the winners.  Germany was humiliated, bankrupt, disenfranchised, etc. A breeding ground for fanatics.  Nazis seized power in 1933 and we know the rest.  The Nazis came into being just like Al Qaeda, ISS etc. A vicious breed of the Allies for being treated unfairly.  That is the truth, but the victorious powers dictate history.  But the crippled Germany manages to work itself back to health even after 2 lost wars and is more popular today than almost any other country.  That&#39;s impressive, but it can also arouse envy.","OverSimplified's ""WW2"" series offers an entertaining and educational take on World War II.

Well done, with little bias that I could see.<br>When I was a kid, the war was closer in time to us than Vietnam was to my 21 year old daughter....or almost as recently as Korea was to me as my daughter was to Desert Storm....and the story we heard as the winners was radically different than your version. In junior high we got a rather weird version of the War....always we were taught about the Holocaust, as though WWII was largely about the Holocaust, the same way many people make the Civil War always about freeing the slaves. It was so much more complicated but we got nothing but freeing the slaves and the South fought to keep their free labor and it wasn&#39;t really that as much as economics....as a matter of fact, in California schools, we were taught that white people hated black people so much they enslaved them as a punishment (I am not kidding). I remember that so vividly it was as though we caught Africans because we despised them and because they were black we wanted to buy them from other Africans and brought them home to torture them. I couldn&#39;t follow the logic, but this was when &quot;Roots&quot; was a big hit on TV.... Public schools in blue states are rather strange. It&#39;s as though Hitler mainly fought the war because he wanted nothing but capturing Jews. I guess you could make that argument....","OverSimplified's ""WW2"" series offers an entertaining and educational take on World War II.

This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son and daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I&#39;m a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uk_6vfqwTA&amp;t=433"">7:13</a>-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It&#39;s not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God&#39;s presence forever where you&#39;re never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can&#39;t continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn&#39;t rise from the dead.
