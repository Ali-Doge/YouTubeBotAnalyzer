We cannot overcome it on our own, Jesus alone overcame sin! He overcame every temptation and paid the price for us! He loves us more than we can imagine. Humble yourselves pray and seek Him above all. Seek Him for mercy and freedom! He can make you completely new through His Spirit which He gives to His people who listens to what He says. His Spirit gives us new life and sets us free from our sinful ways and the ways of the world. He frees us from God&#39;s anger and makes us right with Him! Through faith alone in Jesus, which includes doing what He says, makes us righteous. He gives peace and joy unlike what the world can give. NOTHING on this earth can give joy like He does. His compassion and deep care for us lead Him to suffer for what we deserve to suffer for. Turn away from sin, change your hearts and lives, and seek the Lord above all. Read the word to know more about our Father and creator, and to know about what&#39;s to come and what we need to do. Jesus is coming back! The Kingdom is near. Let us abide in Him, doing away with pride, lying, stealing, cheating, sexual sins including adultery, homosexuality etc. There is not a drop of sin in the Lord, nor will there be any pain or suffering or evil in the Kingdom to come!","""Jim's Pranks Against Dwight"" from The Office US showcases hilarious moments from the popular sitcom.

Once there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom and her dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the More-government decided that best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she died. Now every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a Monday night at 12:00 a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death. Now send this to ten other pictures on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn&#39;t. This isn&#39;t fake. apparently, if you copy and paste this to ten comments in the next ten minutes you will have the best day of your life <a href=""http://tomorrow.you/"">tomorrow.You</a> will either get kissed or asked out, if you break this chain u will see a little dead girl in you<br>im not risking it.","""Jim's Pranks Against Dwight"" from The Office US showcases hilarious moments from the popular sitcom.
