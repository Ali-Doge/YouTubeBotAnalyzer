Germany wanted to get it&#39;s lost lands back, had war declared on them by Judea (the March 24th, 1933 &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper is good proof of this) who would then pay the allies to step in; which was easy as they already owned them through fed reserve banking, and Germany fought communist Russia because it broke their peace treaty with Germany. They were allowed to take part of Poland after the Polish invasion, but Russia didn&#39;t want to stop there, just like they didn&#39;t want to later which led to the cold war. Why did Germany invade Poland? Because poland was a continuous aggressor and kept provoking them into war, along with harming germans within Poland. Hit said, &quot;you have seen, I&#39;ve tried everything to make peace with them. It goes unanswered. We want peace for our people. And if they will not give us peace. We shall go and take it&quot;. <br><br>And Germany didn&#39;t want to be conquered by the Russian Bolsheviks (who were actually Jewish invaders of Russia , Putin himself has openly said this) and get the treatment russians did (holomodor). They had no interest in fighting with france, Britain or America. It was them that teamed up with Russia and China, conveniently the only two com countries, to help spread communism. ( Which, Fun fact: communism came from Karl Marx, a man who&#39;s real name was Chaim Hirschel Mordechai, a Jewish man who was cousins to the Rothchild elites. Make of that what you will). Japan was also fighting communist China, as the CCP was founded in 1929, and was shadow governing Chinas government and trying to bring communism to Japan. America provoked Japan into war by placing severe embargos on them saying they wouldn&#39;t stop until they stopped fighting china. So Japan was given two options: starve, or be taken over by communism. They chose to fight. In japan, some people know this openly and are bitter about ww2 to this day. In reality mr. Mustache tried offering peace to the &quot;allies&quot;, especially Britain over a dozen times, and was ignored. He even offered the German army to protect Britain, and purposely didn&#39;t build up a large naval force so Britain could remain the ruler lf naval affairs. Britain made the first attacks by bombing Germany&#39;s civilian neighborhoods and towns. For 3 whole months Hit ordered his men to wait it out and not attack. But eventually he had to react, people wanted him to as well, about his people being bombed and his offers of peace being ignored so in return he bombed their harbors, intentionally not civilian areas. The German Air Force commander recalled suggesting to bomb London to hit. His response was, &quot;no, I don&#39;t want this. The British are just like us, we are so similar. I&#39;ve never wanted war with them&quot;. Honestly, Germany might not have lost if he didn&#39;t do so many displays of good will during the war. He had so much respect for the other countries that when they took Paris, a place he mindfully never bombed, he risked his life to go and admire the art and architecture.<br><br>But Churchhill didn&#39;t care, he was being paid to continue his attack. In an interview churchhill was asked if he had considered peace negotiating with Germany. He replied, &quot;heavens no, they&#39;d accept immediately&quot;. There are newspapers from that time period headlined &quot;Hit** Pleas For Peace&quot; as well. There&#39;s much more to this but that&#39;s a good enough picture. So no, Germany wasn&#39;t trying to take over the world, that was Russia. They wanted their land back, and they defended themselves/fought communism. Every country the Germans went to, were welcomed as liberators there are many witnesses to this fact; people didn&#39;t want to be under Bolshevik communism. In the end communism won thanks to ww2. welcome to our modern world. Some people actually caught on to this in their time. US general George Patton flat out said, &quot;this war is semitic in nature. we fought the wrong enemy. Now all of Europe will be communists&quot;.(Different quotes of him stitched for space).  And he died under mysterious circumstances before ever coming back from Germany. that&#39;s what a lot of mainstream historians like to leave out; context. <br><br>One of the best sources you can find on this is from an English historian, David Irving. He wrote a book called &quot;Hit xxxs war&quot; (yt will delete if I spell it right). Or a documentary called &quot;Europa The Last Battle&quot;. It&#39;s not a bunch of propaganda or sympathetic work, it&#39;s hard facts with records and documents. Much more than any of these mainstream videos have.",1,0

UgzPiAXllal6UyId5cd4AaABAg,@121BuyIt,2024-01-02T22:48:59Z,"They dont know me son. <br><br><br>The AK-47, officially known as the Avtomat Kalashnikova (Russian: –ê–≤—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç –ö–∞–ª–∞—à–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞, lit. &#39;Kalashnikov&#39;s automatic [rifle]&#39;; also known as the Kalashnikov or just AK), is a gas-operated assault rifle that is chambered for the 7.62√ó39mm cartridge. Developed in the Soviet Union by Russian small-arms designer Mikhail Kalashnikov, it is the originating firearm of the Kalashnikov (or &quot;AK&quot;) family of rifles. After more than eight decades since its creation, the AK-47 model and its variants remain one of the most popular and widely used firearms in the world.<br><br>Design work on the AK-47 began in 1945. It was presented for official military trials in 1947, and, in 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service for selected units of the Soviet Army. In early 1949, the AK was officially accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces[9] and used by the majority of the member states of the Warsaw Pact.<br><br>The model and its variants owe their global popularity to their reliability under harsh conditions, low production cost (compared to contemporary weapons), availability in virtually every geographic region, and ease of use. The AK has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces and insurgencies throughout the world. As of 2004, &quot;of the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s&quot;.[4] The model is the basis for the development of many other types of individual, crew-served, and specialized firearms.<br><br>History<br>Origins<br>During World War II, the Sturmgewehr 44 rifle used by German forces made a deep impression on their Soviet counterparts.[10][11] The select-fire rifle was chambered for a new intermediate cartridge, the 7.92√ó33mm Kurz, and combined the firepower of a submachine gun with the range and accuracy of a rifle.[12][13] On 15 July 1943, an earlier model of the Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the People&#39;s Commissariat of Arms of the USSR.[14] The Soviets were impressed with the weapon and immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber fully automatic rifle of their own,[10][11] to replace the PPSh-41 submachine guns and outdated Mosin‚ÄìNagant bolt-action rifles that armed most of the Soviet Army.[15]<br><br>The Soviets soon developed the 7.62√ó39mm M43 cartridge, used in[14] the semi-automatic SKS carbine and the RPD light machine gun.[16] Shortly after World War II, the Soviets developed the AK-47 rifle, which quickly replaced the SKS in Soviet service.[17][18] Introduced in 1959, the AKM is a lighter stamped steel version and the most ubiquitous variant of the entire AK series of firearms. In the 1960s, the Soviets introduced the RPK light machine gun, an AK-type weapon with a stronger receiver, a longer heavy barrel, and a bipod, that eventually replaced the RPD light machine gun.[16]<br><br>Concept<br>Mikhail Kalashnikov began his career as a weapon designer in 1941 while recuperating from a shoulder wound that he received during the Battle of Bryansk.[5][19] Kalashnikov himself stated...&quot;I was in the hospital, and a soldier in the bed beside me asked: &#39;Why do our soldiers have only one rifle for two or three of our men when the Germans have automatics?&#39; So I designed one. I was a soldier, and I created a machine gun for a soldier. It was called an Avtomat Kalashnikova, the automatic weapon of Kalashnikov‚ÄîAK‚Äîand it carried the year of its first manufacture, 1947.&quot;[20]<br><br>The AK-47 is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations. &quot;Kalashnikov decided to design an automatic rifle combining the best features of the American M1 Garand and the German StG 44.&quot;[21] Kalashnikov&#39;s team had access to these weapons and did not need to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;. Kalashnikov himself observed: &quot;A lot of Russian Army soldiers ask me how one can become a constructor, and how new weaponry is designed. These are very difficult questions. Each designer seems to have his own paths, his own successes and failures. But one thing is clear: before attempting to create something new, it is vital to have a good appreciation of everything that already exists in this field. I myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so.&quot;[19]<br><br>Some claimed that Kalashnikov copied designs like Bulkin&#39;s TKB-415[22] or Simonov&#39;s AVS-31.[23]<br><br>Early designs<br>Kalashnikov started work on a submachine gun design in 1942[24] and light machine gun design in 1943.[25][26] Early in 1944, Kalashnikov was given some 7.62√ó39mm M43 cartridges and informed that other designers were working on weapons for this new Soviet small-arms cartridge. It was suggested that a new weapon might well lead to greater things. He then undertook work on the new rifle.[27] In 1944, he entered a design competition with this new 7.62√ó39mm, semi-automatic, gas-operated, long-stroke piston carbine, strongly influenced by the American M1 Garand.[28] The new rifle was in the same class as the SKS-45 carbine, with a fixed magazine.

There government was a Autocracy.<br>With the Kaiser being in charge of everything. But since the Kaiser was exiled.<br>Something called The Weimar Constitution was in control.<br>The Weimar was a Republic Government and the way they worked was very poor. The Person in charge was Friedrich Ebert, The system was that you would have a President, and below that was the Chancellor, The Way the Election System worked is that Each German Party State would get votes and a system called Proportional Representation would be introduced, But it was a crappy System. For example, If group 1 got 10% of votes, Group 2 got 20% of votes<br>group 3 got 5% of votes,<br>group 4 got 10% of votes<br>Who is gonna win? Group 2 right? Cool, but now you have 25% of the majority pissed off.<br>And you had to get atleast above 51% to win over.<br>So since the Weimar Republic was stuck. People got tired of being low on food and everything, So what comes next? Riots.<br>But after the Riots, The people look for a Strong Government, So 2 party&#39;s come into play. Fascism, Autocracy and Extreme Right Wing.<br>And from the USSR, Communism, Extreme left wing.<br>People look for answers and it tense was rising.<br>But then, you had 3 million Soliders come back from the war, Now you have 3 million Soldiers Unemployed and wanting jobs food etc.<br>So Revolts happen, people Protest for communism and some for Fascism.<br>So Friedrich Ebert needs help and funds the army to come help, So it gets a Regiment involved and they go kill the Protesters, They cant arrest them since they wouldn&#39;t have anything to charge since protesting is a right. So Fascism after witnessing stops revolting. Hitler, who was in the Fascism side, realised and said &quot;You cant overthrow this Weimar Government Illegally&quot; So after many Revolts, Hitler then goes into Politics, and low and behold, 1933 Hitlers Fascist Nazi Party takes over Germany.<br><br>Thats the Story of Weimar Constitution.<br>OVERSIMPLIFIED PLEASE DO A VIDEO ON THE WEIMAR CONSTITUTION.",0,0

UgzpCmFN4yGJLIWR31p4AaABAg,@KnightttttMare,2023-05-30T00:35:35Z,"World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world&#39;s countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.<br><br>The causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet‚ÄìJapanese border conflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe, and European tensions in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their &quot;spheres of influence&quot; across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, in a military alliance with Italy, Japan and other countries called the Axis. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.<br><br>Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States and United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity. Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943‚Äîincluding a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific‚Äîcost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its allies back. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands. The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories and the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitler&#39;s suicide, and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration (issued 26 July 1945), the United States dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union&#39;s declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945.<br><br>World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe and set the foundation for the international order of the world&#39;s nations for the rest of the 20th century and into the present day. The United Nations was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts,[1] with the victorious great powers‚ÄîChina, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States‚Äîbecoming the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political and economic integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities, and forge a sense of common identity.",0,0

Mussolini actually had a bigger idea than to just get in on the action. You see, about 50 years ago, Italy attempted to colonise Abyssinia, but were absolutely destroyed, to the point where people in Rome and Florence kept chanting the name of the Emperor of Abyssinia. And Mussolini was kinda embarrassed of that and he didn&#39;t want his race to be portrayed that way. Also, their stay in Abyssinia wasn&#39;t all that great. For every single one of the 5 years they spent there, a full scale battle was held by guerrilla fighters which is not optimal for colonists(partly the reason why that colony still didn&#39;t get official). Secondly, one of the commanders, which was basically the king, lost his leg just because he was in the country. Not fighting, just being there. Oh yeah, by the way you completely messed up the name, as far back as 1850 it was called Ethiopia, not Abyssinia.",0,0

Their father wanted them to do a favor for him. ‚ÄúI want you boys to get a watch that was stolen from me by a man named Jack Spade.He should be near a town called Snakebite Ridge.<br> <br>1.‚Äù What‚Äôs so important about this watch? said Arthur. But before their father could answer, he died from Tuberculosis. The two brothers buried their father in the backyard of their family home and paid their respects. After they paid their respects, they question about jack spade. ‚ÄúJack Spade? ‚ÄúI had never heard father mention this name before, said John. ‚ÄúMaybe we should ask mother about Jack Spade,said Arthur. the two Brothers questioned their mother Abigail Morgan about jack spade. Their mother said: ‚ÄúJack Spade is in a gang called The Blackjack gang. ‚ÄúThey are the most dangerous gang in this part of the west. ‚ÄúSo be careful. She also tells them that when they get the watch back, they should go back home so that she can show them something. They both agree to come back when they get the watch.  Their mother gives them both a revolver for self-defense. So, they both saddle up to set off to Snakebite Ridge looking for jack spade. Unknowingly going on an adventure that will change their lives forever.<br> <br>2.The brothers reach the entrance of Snakebite Ridge after a long and brutal journey through the Texas heat. The brothers decide to split up to cover more ground. Arthur said to John.‚Äù I‚Äôm gonna look around and ask about jack spade. ‚ÄúWhile you go to the store and buy us some supplies. Arthur gives John a list of things they need. And when we‚Äôre done, we‚Äôll regroup at the The Two-Bit Saloon.says Arthur.<br>So, the two brothers split up.Arthur goes to question the sheriff about jack spade. While John heads to the store to buy the supplies. Arthur opens the door to the sheriff&#39;s office and sees the sheriff smoking a cigarette while sitting on a chair. ‚ÄúWhat do you want kid? said the sheriff. ‚ÄúI want to ask a few questions. Replied Arthur. ‚ÄúAbout what? Said the sheriff. ‚ÄúAbout jack spade. Replied Arthur. The sheriff sighs and says, ‚ÄúVery well I will tell you whatever you want to know.Arthur sits down and asks the sheriff about jack spade.‚Äù Why is everybody scared of jack spade. ‚ÄúI asked some town folk about jack spade but they either ignored me or ran away. The sheriff responded by pointing at a wanted poster on the wall and says ‚ÄúThat wanted poster should answer your questions. Arthur picks up the wanted and reads it. It reads‚Äù Jack Spade wanted for multiple murders and bank robbery. $100 to Whoever captures him dead or alive. Arthur finishes reading the wanted poster and says‚Äù100 dollars! Says Arthur.‚ÄúThanking of capturing him,says the sheriff. ‚ÄúMaybe, says Arthur. Will, if you are planning to capture him just be careful because several people tried to capture him but failed. ‚ÄúNoted. Said Arthur. So, Arthur went to The Two-Bit Saloon,<br>To regroup with John. Arthur opens the door of the saloon and finds John waiting for him. Arthur asked John if he had bought the supplies.John simply nodded. The two brothers have a <br>conversation about what to do next,but before they can finish, they hear a loud bang! They looked outside to see what was happening. ‚ÄúIs that Jack spade? said Arthur. ‚ÄúWhat is he doing here? asked John. Jack Spade screamed for the mayor to get out. ‚ÄúMayor, if you don‚Äôt get down here, I‚Äôm gonna go in there and kill you myself! The mayor slowly walked out of the mayor&#39;s office. ‚ÄúWhere is my money? Shouted Jack. I will get your money. Give me a few weeks. Said the mayor. I‚Äôll give you only three days and if you don‚Äôt have the money, I will kill everyone in this town. Shouted Jack. Jack and his gang shortly left the town. After Jack leaves, the brothers   question the mayor about what just happened. ‚ÄúThat was Jack Spade. He always comes to town and asks for money or else he‚Äôll destroy the town,said the mayor. The brothers ask him where Jack Spade‚Äôs hideout was. The mayor tells them that jack spade‚Äôs hideout is in an abandoned mine. The mayor tells them to be safe. The brothers now know where to go, so they settle up and set off to the abandoned mine.<br> <br>3. The brothers reach the entrance of the abandoned mine. The entrance was heavily guarded, so the brothers decided to flank them from both ways. I am going left, and you are going right. John said to Arthur. So, the brothers take their positions and start firing. A giant gunfight in shoes. John and Arthur were heavily out numbered,but their father taught them well. So, they killed all Jack‚Äôs guards. Now only Jack was left. The brothers shouted for Jack to come out of the mine. Jack slowly comes out of the cave and says, ‚ÄúWhat do you kids want? ‚ÄúWe want our father&#39;s watch back,says Arthur. ‚ÄúOver my dead body. Replied jack. So, the brothers get ready for a duel. The brothers stand 10 feet away from Jack and wait for him to make a move. The place stays silent until. Bang! ‚Ä¶",1,0

It involved many nations and was fought in multiple theaters across the world. The main belligerents were the Allied Powers, led by Mario, and the Axis Powers, led by the Goombas.<br><br>The war began when the Goombas invaded Poland in 1939. This led to the declaration of war by Mario and his allies. The Goombas quickly expanded their conquests, taking over many European countries, including France and the Netherlands. Mario and his allies fought back, eventually pushing the Goombas out of Africa and Italy.<br><br>The war in the Pacific theater was also fierce, with the Goombas attacking Pearl Harbor in 1941, leading to Mario&#39;s entry into the war. The Goombas were eventually defeated in Asia and the Pacific by Mario and his allies, culminating in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.<br><br>The war resulted in the deaths of millions of people, including soldiers and civilians. It also caused immense destruction to infrastructure and left many countries in ruins. The Holocaust, a genocide committed by the Goombas against the Jewish people, was also a significant atrocity of the war.<br><br>The aftermath of the war led to the creation of the United Nations and the formation of new political boundaries. It also resulted in the beginning of the Cold War between Mario and his allies and the Soviet Union.<br><br>In conclusion, World War II was a devastating conflict that had far-reaching consequences. The aggression of the Goombas led to the deaths of millions and caused immeasurable suffering. It is a stark reminder of the dangers of nationalism and the importance of international cooperation in preventing future conflicts.",0,0

Serbia assassinates the crown prince (archduke/heir apparent) of austria ungary, they declare war (at that time wars were declared and fought for less), Russia honors their alliance treaty with Serbia and declares war on Austria Ungary, then Germany honors their alliance with Austria Ungary and declares war on Russia, then UK declares war and France joins... if anyone started the war, it was Serbia and not Germany, yet Germany gets blamed for starting WW1 and got punished the worst when defeated, much much worss then any other war losing party in 2000 years before (there are even unproven rumors that UK orchestrated and paid for the assassination, which would put this into even more interesting perspective).<br>By 1916 Germany won the war, France all but defeated, UK at the brink of total defeat with food and ammunition only few weeks worth left. Thats when the global finance mafia enters the stage and proposes to UK a plan how to save it and make USA enter the war at the &quot;entente&quot; side, to bring their plans into fruition, they used all their influence and money to start communist riots in Germany to destroy it from within, and get USA into entering the war. They succeeded.<br>Fast forward a few years, some weird guy called Hitler enters the stage, the most important thing to mention is, that he disconnects Germany from the world finance mafia, which in turn declares war on Germany (there are enough documents proving it, if you are willing to look for it, but not in your average history book). After a few years where this finance mafia does everything to get their way, Germany finaly retaliates and oh boy, the members of the finance group got what they had coming, they poked a snake and were biten. Meanwhile, ethnic germans living on polish territory, german lands that was given to poland after WW1, were tortured, raped and killed by the poles, with few million members of this finance group being &quot;polish&quot; (I hope you see the picture, why so many poles had to suffer), poland even said, before there was a war, that they will force Germany into a war that they, the Germans, could not avoid, backed by UK... and when the war started, UK abandoned their promises to poland. After Germany won their Blitzkrieg, they offered peace and return all lands to Poland and all they wanted in return was safe passage to the Danzig enclave and the dignity of Germans living on polish territory, that is also very well documented, but not in the average history book. There are also many peace proposals going to UK, all ignored. The interesting part here is, the history books tell us UK did not honor their promises because they hoped Hitlers conquering bloodlust will be quenchend when he is done with Poland. But they did not accept Germans peace proposals. A little bit controverse, isn&#39;t it? Or maybe because they Germans were not to be trusted, a little bit too conventient, isnt it?<br>In the end, million HUMANS died, the race and nationality does not matter, millions suffered, and we will suffer again when we dont learn from it and stop telling weird stories that there is only one vilain and some saints. Hitler was not a villain and Churchill/Roosevelt/Stalin were no saints.<br>After the war mr Paton, US general, said &quot;we fought the wrong enemy&quot; and then was killed like anyone else.",0,0

Ugwt9UUdyd-NksxxHiB4AaABAg,@Carl.90,2022-11-26T07:39:28Z,"So, lets get this straight, <br>The major participants in the war threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and deploying the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.<br><br>World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history; it resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.<br><br>The causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, the Spanish Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese border conflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe and rising European tensions since World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their &quot;spheres of influence&quot; across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan (with other countries later). Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.<br><br>Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity. Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943‚Äîincluding a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific‚Äîcost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned towards Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands.<br><br>The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories and the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitler&#39;s suicide, and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration (issued 26 July 1945), the United States dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on 9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union&#39;s declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945.<br><br>World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The United Nations was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts,[1] with the victorious great powers‚ÄîChina, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States‚Äîbecoming the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political and economic integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense of common identity.<br><br>Non simplified<br>Your very welcome.",1,0

It wasn&#39;t until the end of 1944 that you showed a certain free territory on the territory of today&#39;s Serbia. I&#39;d like you to take a look at that.

Maybe they couldn&#39;t have succeeded in an invasion of America, at least not while the war was unfolding, but we came very close to being a German speaking planet. The battles up to Dunkirk and the fall of France was absolutely terrifying. Can you imagine being alive then?

The reason why the Qing Dynasty army is in Korea is because Korea asked for help from the Qing Dynasty. At that time, Korea was corrupt. Therefore, the Donghak Peasant Movement took place, saying that civilians could no longer tolerate corruption and drove out the corrupt imperial family. So Korea tried to send troops to suppress them, but they lost to Donghak Peasant Army. So Korea asked the Qing Dynasty for help. However, Japan suddenly entered Korean land without permission and occupied Seoul. Since then, Japan has attacked the returning Qing army, and the Sino-Japanese War broke out on the Korean Peninsula.",12,1

He was honest, but also calculating. And the reason he accepted that wasn&#39;t because he was a fool, but because of how smart he was. At the time German numbers were far superior and Germany was better prepared for war. Chamberlain hoped he could use appeasement to avoid a war, but he also used it to buy time to prepare his own forces. After learning all this I feel bad for how Chamberlain he been misrepresented by historians and modern media.",0,0

I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.&quot; Revelations 3:20 most importantly Luke 13:1‚Äì5‚ÄîNow there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 2 Jesus answered, ‚ÄúDo you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? 3 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. 4 Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them‚Äîdo you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? 5 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.‚Äù and john 3:5&quot;Jesus answered, ‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.&quot;  So Ask God Himself  To be Baptized into the spirit invite him into your life personally just in your mind or spirit, I&#39;m debating putting a prayer in here but i genuinely think you should ask out of your heart also you should repent of all your sins ima just let you see how to out the bible, &quot;8 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.&quot; 1 john 1:8-10 God Bless God Love God Prosper i pray he remove the veil around your heart so you may see",0,0

The Pacific War is a crusade of self-defense of Japan and the liberation in Asia. Therefore I enlighten it in this way to let you notice it because the American nation has the crime and reflect. Japan is justice, and the United States is the devil. The World War 3 of Japan and the devil fight. When the world right becomes extinct in a nuclear war, a Japanese savior stands up. A kingdom is thereby established for Christian 1,000 years. The world people are brainwashed by the devil and are lost to the hell. A messenger of God introduces the Gospel into the world in this way to save it.<br><br><br><br>The Freemason rules the world, and this organization is writing a scenario to most war.<br><br><br><br>In Japan, it was blockaded the economy by encircling ABCD, and oil was embargoed. This means death for a modern nation. Electricity stops, and a production line stops and cannot prevent the aggression of other countries when a weapon equipped with an engine is not usable. Therefore I make the first move for self-defense, and Pearl Harbor is to have attacked it. The United States won against war and I made demonstration of the power of the atom bomb in the Soviet Union and did a hero side and controlled the world after the war. And I got colony, Japan of the best money tree. The United States hit the commission of the slave who made money in an article made in Japan produced in high technology and was able to become the King who could enjoy luxury. The Okinawa return of the United States still controls Japan effectively with the thing only for forms and will have the colony. The reason why the eirei that scuttled itself fought till the last is that I prevent the colonial rule. I believed that Japan revived as far as the Japanese spirit continued and closed my eyes forever.<br><br><br><br>The founding of a country of the United States slaughters the native candy reperception and begins by having plundered the territory. Europe and America of the principle of cruel supremacy of white invaded Asia and had the colony. Roosevelt, Churchill with a sense of crisis, the Stalin and others stopped at Japan which won against Russo-Japanese War against it gaining power and gathered and provoked Japan and drained Propaganda which trained Japan to be an invader and were going to let Japan ruin. A wirepuller of Chiang Kai-shek was these free Mason and let you carry out an anti-Japan activity and repeated Japanese slaughter of tushu case<br><br>The retaliation becomes the Shanghai incidents. Japan built the Manchurian country and was going to build the utopia by the rule of virtue. Japan makes a Mongoloid Korean of the same kind a sex slave and cannot slaughter the Chinese very much in Nanjing. I will pass not only Europe and America but also Asia to the enemy if I do something like that and Japan stands alone and ruins myself. I cannot perform such a suicidal act.<br><br><br><br> When it did Pearl Harbor attack, only sank a superannuation warship; misfired. You set the second attack, and why did you not blow up an airport base, a naval shipyard, an oil tank? You occupied Hawaii, and did you not do an aircraft carrier confrontation? In brief, this Pearl Harbor attack angered the American nation, and the fighting spirit was a stratagem to let you become exalted. Emperor Showa, cabinet minister, all the navy government bodies were Mason.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The equality was the concept that Mason thought about, and a phase contradicted freedom each other. If a company raises profit freely, there is it, and a rich person and poorman do not become equal. Freedom is restricted if I have the frames saying that I do it equally. Freedom and the equality are Operation double eagle of Mason. Of the quarrel that is fixed all the same not antagonism with the thing which Mason produced in both the liberalism nation and the communist state only play it. As for being hidden in the depths as for the commander-in-chief (Israel) of the evil in Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD. The world is instructed with structure braking  under the pretense of two generals (Russia) quarrelling with one general (the United States) very much. In other words, Russia is together with the United States and rigs. Roosevelt ordered three Soviet Union from Stalin by a secret agreement of Yalta. The United States let money pay to Japan and, at the time of the Soviet Union collapse, saved the Soviet Union. Where is antagonism?<br><br>The Democratic Party copulates, too, and the LDP only rigs in the same way, too. Therefore I am under the patronage of Mason even if whichever wins. The American Republican and Democratic parties is the same, too. In other words, cards are marionettes of Mason. North Korea and the United States only perform a fixed quarrel when I understand this thing, and it is revealed that the United States lets you shoot a missile for Japan.<br><br><br><br>Cards and Putin advocate anti-Judea, but it is a downright lie. The Nazis advocated anti-Judea, too, but Germany of the defeated nation of World War I was made to assume a burden of the indemnification payment, and why did you manage to raise those war expenditures? I received support of the Judah iron. The Nazis had techniques such as a rocket, atom bomb development, the UFO production. Nazi cannot lose. In other words, I lost on purpose.<br><br><br><br>I let you accept the Plaza Accord and guide it to the strong yen that the United States makes Japan a bubble burst as for the Japan Airlines airplane 123 flights accident and snatches Japanese financial power of a nation by financial products (dice game gambling to say that the stock prices of Japan fall) and a share price manipulation and a fraud to say and am a threat case to lead it to the stock prices sudden fall. Salomon Brothers which sold a stock at a profit before a sudden fall obtained a vast profit. A pilot at U.S. forces shot it down and burnt the person whom a Korean military unit survived to death by a flame thrower. I shot a member of Self-Defense Forces with the sense of justice that was going to help it dead. As for the conduct like this devil being possible, there is only Mason. Therefore Boeing accepted the repair error of the false charge. Boeing refuses the act of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces decidedly.<br><br><br><br>Near future to read from Revelation of Sun and Moon GOD and illuminaty card, and to untie it in Japan<br><br>April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, Korea, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3 (Armageddon of the nuclear war). It is the last war with original God and the evil god. Japan is the country which original God protects in a land of the gods, and the evil god (Freemason) holds the Japanese people hostage and is made to have an experience cruel most because it is the stomach which is going to conquer original God.<br><br>x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021 (the black ship second coming).<br><br>World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day (Armageddon of the nuclear war).<br><br> Mount Fuji is a great eruption on xx day in October, 2023. The natural disasters such as major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. <br><br>An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023. The earth becomes muddy sea. <br><br>The world (Buddhists&#39; paradise) of the Maitreya is realized on xx moon xx day in 2024.<br><br><br><br>Final note<br><br>The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. The human being takes the life of the lovely animal unconcernedly. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. A fornication is an act of the beast profaning God. A thing of the world is a thing of God, and the devil is the thief who stole the world from God and is a fraud deceiving the people. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. It is the devil that it behaves like God in original God that the devil can see in the present world. Therefore a disaster, an epidemic, the war damage giving an evil to the people are the wrath of Heaven. Why was much human life robbed of it by the Great East Japan Earthquake? As for it, a human evil deed was judged Big God. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. I lead the world to the World War 3 that Freemason finally acts as order of the evil. I let a vindictive spirit does satanophany in the Freemason, and war cause. The World War 3 is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light. Are all of you ready?%%%$#$#$@/the Manchurian country was the breakwater which prevented aggression of the European and American Great Powers.",0,0

It was unacceptable that Germany was already industrially superior in Europe during its imperial period and that the English empire was losing face.  The English sterling silver also lost value, etc. Therefore, plans were made to bring the German Empire to its knees.  But the strengthened Germany could never have been defeated militarily alone.  You saw it in 1870, when France under Napoleon III declared war on us and the German Reich humiliated France with a blitzkrieg in less than 12 months.  Now our sister state France also hated us, although many years earlier Napoleon had devastated Germany and all of Europe.  Envy and lust for power can be so bad that England forgot they came from the German Anglo-Saxons and France from the German Franks, among others.  The Allied plan worked and the First World War began in 1914.  Today, even foreign historians say that Germany did not start the war alone, but the US intervened in 1917 because they feared that England and France would lose the war and that both countries would not repay their enormous debts to the US afterwards.  After losing the war, Germany was forced to accept sole guilt and pay such high reparations that it could never get up again.  The Allies also stole about 2500 patents (inventions) from us.  That shows the disgust of the winners.  Germany was humiliated, bankrupt, disenfranchised, etc. A breeding ground for fanatics.  Nazis seized power in 1933 and we know the rest.  The Nazis came into being just like Al Qaeda, ISS etc. A vicious breed of the Allies for being treated unfairly.  That is the truth, but the victorious powers dictate history.  But the crippled Germany manages to work itself back to health even after 2 lost wars and is more popular today than almost any other country.  That&#39;s impressive, but it can also arouse envy.",0,1

I did some research and that&#39;s a republican. <br><br>Radical nationalism is an ideology formulated by Arnold Vinnick. In many ways, it is the anti-thesis of Communism.<br>In the Nationalist Manifesto, written by Arnold Vinnick, the ideology of Nationalism is clearly defined.<br>&quot;The first, original, and truly natural boundaries of states are beyond doubt their internal boundaries. Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole.&quot; (Nationalist Manifesto, Vinnick, p.34)<br>RADICAL NATIONALISM... CHECK.<br>Under totalitarian rule, traditional social institutions and organizations are discouraged and suppressed. Thus, the social fabric is weakened and people become more amenable to absorption into a single, unified movement. Participation in approved public organizations is at first encouraged and then required. Old religious and social ties are supplanted by artificial ties to the state and its ideology. As pluralism and individualism diminish, most of the people embrace the totalitarian state‚Äôs ideology. The infinite diversity among individuals blurs, replaced by a mass conformity (or at least acquiescence) to the beliefs and behaviour sanctioned by the state.<br>TOTALITARIANISM... arguable but theoretically permits no individual freedom, which republicans would deny vehemently.<br>Militarism: The belief that a country should maintain a strong military capability and be prepared to use it aggressively to defend or promote national interests.<br>VIOLENCE AND MILITARISM... CHECK. The republican party has a strong history of military violence and expansion.<br>From The New York Times...<br>An anti-democratic movement, inspired by Donald Trump but much larger than him, is making significant progress, as my colleague Charles Homans has reported. In the states that decide modern presidential elections, this movement has already changed some laws and ousted election officials, with the aim of overturning future results. It has justified the changes with blatantly false statements claiming that Biden did not really win the 2020 election.<br>The movement has encountered surprisingly little opposition. Most leading Republican politicians have either looked the other way or supported the anti-democratic movement. In the House, Republicans ousted Liz Cheney from a leadership position because she called out Trump‚Äôs lies.<br>The pushback within the Republican Party has been so weak that about 60 percent of Republican adults now tell pollsters that they believe the 2020 election was stolen ‚Äî a view that‚Äôs simply wrong.<br>Most Democratic officials, for their part, have been focused on issues other than election security, like Covid-19 and the economy. It‚Äôs true that congressional Democrats have tried to pass a new voting rights bill, only to be stymied by Republican opposition and the filibuster. But these Democratic efforts have been sprawling and unfocused. They have included proposals ‚Äî on voter-ID rules and mail-in ballots, for example ‚Äî that are almost certainly less important than a federal law to block the overturning of elections, as The Times‚Äôs Nate Cohn has explained.<br>ANTI DEMOCRATIC... CHECK.<br>Past stances on Socialist Policies and numerous articles make this a no-brainer.<br>ANTI-SOCIALISM... CHECK.<br>RACISM... NO COMMENT... CHECK.<br>-----<br>Yah, that research disturbed me...",0,0

UgyusHO9XZVwYfTmbr54AaABAg,@luckyea7,2022-05-09T09:17:03Z,"The Fed, the Bank of England and Switzerland created and financed Hitler and the Third Reich to kill the USSR. And at the Nuremberg trials, the ex-president of the Reichsbank and the Minister of Economics of Nazi Germany, Hjalmar Schacht, suggested that, for the sake of justice, those who nurtured the Third Reich should be put on trial, while mentioning the American corporations General Motors and Ford, as well as the personal manager of the Bank of England Norman Montague.<br><br>The Anglo-Saxons became the root cause and organizers of the bloodiest war in history. Now history is repeating itself. The Anglo-Saxons nurtured and finance neo-Nazi organizations in Ukraine that kill civilians in Ukraine. Only two countries voted against the UN resolution against the glorification of Nazism: the United States and Ukraine.<br><br>For example, the American site Antiwar in its article &quot;Partnering With Neo-Nazis in Ukraine: An Inconvenient History&quot; wrote that the United States is cooperating with Ukrainian neo-Nazis in the war against Russia. The history of this cooperation goes back many years. Moreover, the Americans are well aware of the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists against humanity. But the current Ukrainian neo-Nazis are needed by America in the fight against Russia.<br><br>Financing of the ‚ÄúRight Sector‚Äù banned in Russia and its ‚Äúmilitary wings‚Äù - the ‚ÄúVolunteer Ukrainian Corps‚Äù and the ‚ÄúUkrainian Volunteer Army‚Äù, a number of other neo-Nazi groups is carried out through such foreign organizations as the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (Germany), the British Council, Congress of Ukrainians in Canada. Actually, the coup d&#39;etat in Ukraine in 2014 was carried out on the initiative of Western politicians, because of which Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk regions decided to withdraw from Ukraine, not wanting to be under the rule of neo-Nazis. NATO instructors have been training militants of the neo-Nazi formation &quot;Azov&quot; for several years.<br><br>In November 2015, the US Congress removed amendments that would have limited the supply of weapons, training and other assistance to the neo-Nazi Ukrainian militia &quot;Azov Battalion&quot;.<br><br>In December 2017, Richard Vandiver, a spokesman for the American weapons company AirTronic, said that the sale of lethal weapons to Ukraine was carried out in &quot;very close coordination&quot; with the US Embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãthe State Department, the Pentagon and the Ukrainian government. A few weeks later, the Atlantic Council&#39;s Digital Forensic Research Lab confirmed in a January 2018 report that Azov was the recipient of the weapons.<br><br>Member of the House of Representatives from Georgia Marjorie Taylor Green said that since the Obama days, Democrats have been funding Ukrainian neo-Nazis.<br><br>According to former US Marine Corps intelligence officer Scott Ritter, the US, British and Canadian military visited Ukraine to create nationalist groups in the west of the country. Subsequently, these people overthrew the legitimate President Yanukovych and began to pursue a violent policy. Their influence has become so serious that neo-Nazis even threatened ex-head of state Petro Poroshenko, who was ready to recognize the special status of Donbass in 2015, Ritter noted. A similar fate befell the incumbent President Volodymyr Zelensky.",0,0

Mussolini was outcasted by socialists years before and was never trusted as he was always in it for his own personal gain. The USSR made the pact with Germany out of a need for survival. The USSR in just a little over 20 years was able to industrialize from being a former oligarchy with a massive peasantry to becoming the most industrialized country in the world, which was very crucial in the war as without the USSR, Germany would have taken the UK, and eventually, the US would have signed a pact with Germany. Also, Hitler was inspired by the US manifest destiny with lebensraum, he was literally doing the same thing that the US/Various settler states(The US is the culmination of the greater project of colonialism/settlerism) did to kill 65 million people within 500 years. I just want a good timeline video of WW2 that isn&#39;t sucking America&#39;s dick the whole time. As well, it&#39;s always a good day to remember that while Stalin was not a good person, he&#39;s still better than any US president.

If Japan or any other country backs Ukraine with soldiers like Japan is about to do and there military over Ukraine to help stop Putin from annexing any more old Soviet territory in his next step to push NATO out of his Soviet Warsaw Pact Territory which has been more vunerble and distracted and more vunerable than anytime since WW2  that&#39;s already suffered and lost a lot because there in the middle of the worst pandemic in modern history and now possibly the next world war is right at there doorstep so be very concerned people this is no joke.

This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son and daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I&#39;m a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uk_6vfqwTA&amp;t=433"">7:13</a>-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It&#39;s not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God&#39;s presence forever where you&#39;re never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can&#39;t continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn&#39;t rise from the dead. If you want more help watch the YouTube channel Cleveland street preachers he has been verified by the holy spirit. Also ask the holy spirit to teach you and to guide you in case you haven&#39;t.<br><br>Do any of you need prayer?<br><br>T",0,1

Ugw-oMvb9b08FNTCHnp4AaABAg,@aforandi,2022-02-04T03:48:12Z,"Russia or the Soviet Union lost its Great War. Italy was badly stuffed in combat and had to be propped up by its allies. The French army mutinied in 1917. America won its war in France, in a manner of speaking, given the highly incompetent Pershing and 100,000 deserters in the rear areas. Austro-Hungary didn‚Äôt so much lose as cease to exist. Turkey was attacked from all sides and despite every imaginably national disadvantage put up its usual superlative exhibition of hard fighting that stopped all its enemies, greatly to the pride of the nation. After the Armistice fighting continued everywhere except France. For the Germans, the reasons why they had lost were not apparent [they were in excellent shape in November 1918 [eg. a bumper harvest, a dominant air force], so blame had to be assigned somewhere.<br><br><br>Hitler was 5 foot 10 [180cm]. He was increasingly happy with his political success. He was rather a weak megalomaniac who struggled to impose his will, sometimes threatening people with jail time, whilst in the Soviet Union Stalin shot 20,000 people a day.<br><br>‚ÄòRacist‚Äô is probably wrong [its a slang term anyway, used in this manner], for example in North Africa the Axis got on with the Muslim natives much better than the British. The Nazis were in fact racialist, believing that one race, their Nordic one, was more advanced than others. Hitler‚Äôs only motivation was to set up a thousand-year Reich, hopefully utopian, which would emulate in Russia what the British had achieved in India, where 40,000 whites ruled 500 million natives. His favourite film, ‚ÄòLives of a Bengal Lancer‚Äô, reinforced this desire. ‚ÄòAnti-socialist‚Äô is kinda odd too: the gigantic Nazi holiday camp complex at Prora on Ruegen island would seem to emphasize socialist communality on a massive Nazi scale.<br><br>Germany and Russia were friendly between the wars as they were both members of the Great War loser‚Äôs club. China can be added here, as they were in theory Great War winners who were treated as losers by the actual winners due to perceived racial &amp; national inferiority.<br><br><br>When Hitler came to power, he had no military aircraft or tanks,. and seven years later the German army and air force defeated supposedly strongest army in the world, the French, in hours rather than days. Nazi ‚Äòworld philosophy‚Äô did not demand taking over the world. Germany was not a great power as it lacked a fleet. Their limits were India, which they hoped would continue to give the British major problems, and the Ural mountains, beyond which a Judaeo-Bolshevik state would devolve into barbarism, so proving Nazi philosophy correct. The Nazis were always aware there were only 90 million Germans. Hitler stated he had no interest in North Africa [this may have changed had he known about the oil &amp; gas], and that he had only limited interest in overseas [tropical] possessions.<br><br><br>Appeasement has its problems, as Germany was not appeased with the countries they valued most, like Romania and Bulgaria, because the British valued them too. Hitler was Austrian so Austria hardly counts. Czechoslovakia was somewhat pro-Nazi to begin with, and as ‚Äòa small country far away‚Äô the British clearly didn‚Äôt care about it either.<br><br><br>Nanking was prompted to a degree by the realisation that Japan could not prevail against the Chinese because they were too numerous. Hence they needed biological or atomic weapons, so Special Unit 731 was set up.<br><br><br>Poland: this segment is generally wrong, and I suggest it sounds confused. Britain had pursued a war policy toward Germany because of their mutual desire to control the SE European countries, ie. those NOT used for appeasement. To defeat the German, they had to be engaged on two fronts, so Poland, Romania and other countries were approached with a defensive guarantee. Poland accepted in March 1939. Poland decided to fight rather than acceded to German demands, and this gave Britain its war with Germany, though it also dragged in a reluctant France and placed the Soviet Union on the other side as second-class Nazis. In this way Britain began a second world war. Germany was surprised by Britain‚Äôs declaration of war not least because Poland‚Äôs government was a brutal dictatorship that had always killed its own citizens in small numbers [eg. Jews], whereas Czechoslovakia had been a sunrise democracy. The Phony War was promoted by an especially hard winter in 39-40, but also it suggests something odd about British policy toward Germany. Here it may help to understand that policies up to 1939 were not influenced by events 1940-45, though they are often portrayed as if they were.<br><br><br>Both sides were scared of the other controlling Norway. The Germans had air supremacy, rather than superiority. The British army is defeated by the Germans for the first time. <br>Why did Churchill have a different attitude toward the Germans? Clearly he had had it for many years by 1940.<br><br><br>The idea of a ‚ÄòFrance first, Russia second‚Äô plan is I think completely wrong. The decision to invade the Soviet Union was extremely complex and post-dated the fall of France. The blitzkrieg in France was not planned [the Russian one was], but was implemented day-to-day by progressive panzer generals such as Guderian and Manstein, in this way controlling the battle on the German side. Hitler issued the ‚ÄòStop‚Äô order outside Dunkirk to regain control of his forces ‚Äì again this is a commentary on his weakness as a leader, which goes against the megalomania nonsense, and this at a time when his forces were winning both easily and most unexpectedly. In fact a smaller number panzer divisions, of the ten in total, went through the Ardennes.<br><br><br>The British have been defeated a second time by the Germans. Why should they not make peace? Britain was all alone, with only the entire British empire, American wealth, lots of allies and a number of anti-Soviets and anti-nazis to help them, not to mention an enormous fleet.<br><br><br>American and British relations with Vichy France were particularly perplexed, not least because Vichy and other French entities were mainly in conflict with each other, whilst the side the French people supported most was the French one. Few officers followed the traitor De Gaulle to London, but many volunteered to fight the Soviets with the German army. The Nazis had swept away many enemies of right-wing Frenchmen so their victory wasn‚Äôt seen by them as an entirely bad thing.<br><br><br>The Luftwaffe fought the Battle of Britain to bring the British to peace talks. In 1940 they had little involvement with or ability to influence an Army-Navy invasion plan. Their abilities in naval combat were negligible, and indeed they had no interest in these matters.<br><br><br>It could be mentioned that Churchill was upset that no German bomb fell on a British city for a long time whilst Bomber Command tried and largely failed to carry out its pre-war strategy of winning a war by bombing German cities.",0,1

Germany, Italy, and Japan, all had lining interests in that they were all terrified of being a vassal to the United States they were all terrified of being the small fish, cuz they saw the great Powers came in and carve up and ransacked China, Indochina, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia, and they carved it up like it was property. Japan sat there and they saw this, and thought either we are going to be a big fish and we&#39;re going to have a colony or we&#39;re going to be the little fish and be dominated. Adolf Hitler said Germany will either be an empire or it won&#39;t be at all. Mussolini had similar fears that Italy was now becoming a bystander in world affairs when it used to be the center of the entire world for hundreds of years, so all three of them wanted not to conquer the world but to be on equal footing with the US and UK.

Jesus said that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. God sees your thought life. He requires truth in your inward parts. ‚ÄúWhoever hates his brother is a murderer‚Äù 1 John 3:15. Who of us is guiltless? If you‚Äôve lied you are a liar, and all liars have their part in the lake of fire.<br><br>So how are you going to do on judgement day? We are all going to be guilty and the lake of fire is a reality for all who die in their sins. But God is rich in mercy. Born of a woman, God was manifest in the flesh as Jesus of Nazareth who suffered and died on the cross. He loves us so much that while we were still sinners Christ died painfully for us. He took our punishment so we could be forgiven. Then He raised from the dead and was witnessed by hundreds. You and I broke God‚Äôs Law, Jesus paid the fine. What you and I must do is repent and trust alone in Him. Do that today and you‚Äôll pass from death to life! If you want to learn more about what Jesus did for you, read the gospels.",1,0

He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets.<br>3 A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice;<br>4 he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his teaching¬†the islands¬†will put their hope.‚Äù<br><br>The Arabian Peninsula in Arabic is called ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ≤Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© Al-Jazeera Al-Arabiya which means the Arabian island. Because it is inaccessible due to the desert and water on three sides. Also the oases and towns scattered across the desert are like islands, as the Arabs would call camels &#39;the ship of the desert&#39;. I have also seen the world &quot;islands&quot; translated as &quot;coastlands&quot; like in the Common English Bible or the Complete Jewish Bible.<br>Isaiah 42:10-12<br><br>10 Sing to the Lord a new song,<br>his praise from the ends of the earth,<br>you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it,<br>you islands, and all who live in them.<br>11 Let the wilderness and its towns raise their voices;<br>let the settlements where¬†Kedar¬†lives rejoice.<br>Let the people of¬†Sela¬†sing for joy;<br>let them shout from¬†the mountaintops.<br>12 Let them give glory to the Lord<br>and proclaim his praise in the islands.<br><br>In other translations &quot;the wilderness and its towns&quot; is translated as &quot;the¬†desert¬†and its towns&quot;. Kedar is an ancestor of the Arabs who is named in the Bible and the people of Kedar are the Arabs (definition of Kedar). Additionally the verse which mentions Sela mentions mountaintops.<br>Here is the Complete Jewish Bible translation of Isaiah 42:11-12<br><br>Let¬†the desert and its cities¬†raise their voices,<br>the villages where¬†Kedar¬†lives;<br>let those living in¬†Sela¬†shout for joy;<br>let them cry out from¬†the mountaintops!<br><br>I&#39;m just assuming this translation represents a Jewish understanding of the text because of the name, but I could be wrong.<br>Isaiah 42:20<br><br>You have seen many things, but you pay no attention;<br>your ears are open, but you do not listen.<br><br>The book of Deuteronomy did so as well.<br><br>I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers.¬†And I will put my words in his mouth, and¬†he shall speak to them all that I command him. [Deuteronomy 18:18]<br>This is God speaking to Moses. The Jews said that the Prophet will be from the children of Israel, but when you read further,<br>‚ÄúNo prophet ever rose again in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew with such great intimacy‚Äù [Deuteronomy 34:10]&quot;<br>The Prophet could not have been from the children of Israel. He must have been a gentile. Because otherwise, this would be a clear contradiction in the book of Deuteronomy. It can only be removed when assuming that the said Prophet was a gentile.<br><br>The &#39;whom i uphold&#39; part is actually said to be intentionally falsified. The original hebrew word used there was the name Ahmad, which basically has the same meaning as Muhammad.<br>But if you change it just a little bit, you get &#39;whom i uphold&#39;.<br><br>some as the southmost part of the Desert of Paran (which scholars linked or identified with the Sinai Desert) or the entire desert, and others said that it is a collective name of a mountain range between the Zin Desert and the Sinai Desert.<br><br>I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. [Deuteronomy 18:18]<br>There are some important details provided in this short prophecy. We are told that this future Prophet will be similar to Moses (‚Äúa prophet like you‚Äù). We are also told that he will be a mouthpiece for God as he will faithfully relay all of God‚Äôs commands (‚Äúhe shall speak to them all that I command him‚Äù). This verse also reveals the people from which the Prophet will<br><br> arise, ‚Äúfrom among their brothers‚Äù. An important question we must consider is which people does ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù refer to here?<br>The prophet was a gentile. And the Prophet referred to here is Muhammad(Saw).<br>It‚Äôs important to note that biblical geographers differ as to the exact location of Paran. However, they are unanimous that Paran is somewhere within Arabia. From Clarke‚Äôs Commentary on the Bible:<br>He dwelt in the wilderness of Paran ‚Äì This is generally allowed to have been a part of the desert belonging to Arabia Petraea, in the vicinity of Mount Sinai; and this seems to be its uniform meaning in the sacred writings. Strong‚Äôs Bible Dictionary also tells us that<br>Paran is a desert of Arabia:<br>H6290 paÃÇ‚ÄôraÃÇn From H6286; ornamental; Paran, a desert of Arabia: ‚Äì Paran. Sebeos, a seventh century Armenian bishop and historian, when describing the Arab conquest of his time, wrote that the Arabs ‚Äúassembled and came out from Paran‚Äù [5].<br>Encyclopaedia Biblica, edited by Reverend T. K. Cheyne, asserts: ‚ÄúParan refers to the Arab tribal names, farran or faran.‚Äù<br>The Bible tells us that Paran is the very place where Ishmael dwelt: ‚ÄúWhile he (Ishmael) was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt‚Äù [Genesis 21:21]<br><br><br>The dwelling place of Ishmael was none other than Arabia. The Dead Sea Scrolls, which are dated to the second century BCE and represent the oldest surviving manuscript evidence for the Old Testament along with other apocryphal books, link Ishmael, his descendants and Paran to Arabia:<br>&quot;And Ishmael and his sons, and the sons of Keturah and their sons, went together and dwelt from Paran to the entering in of Babylon in all the land which is towards the East facing the desert. And these mingled with each other, and their name was called Arabs, and Ishmaelite.&quot;<br>Hence, the Paran (or Pharan) of Ishmael was certainly in the Arabian Peninsula. In fact, we can narrow this location down further. Modern academic research supports the claim that Ishmael‚Äôs Paran was indeed in a specific part of Arabia known as Hijaz,<br>modern-day Western Saudi Arabia. Irfan Shahid, one of the world‚Äôs most renowned authorities on pre-Islamic, ancient Arabian geography/history, stated that there was a place called Pharan in Hijaz, which belonged to the Sulaym tribe . Professor Haseeb<br><br> Shehada, an Israeli scholar and professor, in his translation of the Samaritan version of the Torah suggested an identification of the wilderness of Paran with the desert of Western Arabia which is known today as Hijaz<br><br>and when the Jews went to the Christ and asked for a sign he said children of men there shall be no sign except Jonah sign<br>which is living three times when he was supposed to die each<br><br>in the sea a whale sallowed him <br><br>In the whale belly he was spat into the island<br><br>On the Island a pumpkin grew on him<br><br>So Jesus was<br><br>seen eating fish and honeycomb after his crossing by the disciples <br><br>seen walking after being buried and a rock was put on his grave by a women<br><br>and a third which he will comeback on<br><br><br><br>&quot;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet,¬†until¬†Shiloh comes, and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.&quot; (Genesis 49:10).<br>This means the Shiloh cannot be from Judah.",0,0

Because at that time, Britain and the rest of Europe would have been steamrolled. Even Hitler himself regrets not striking France and Britain a year earlier.

My grandma was a Ukrainian Slav who worked on a farm, and a woman named Frau Huber had a daughter who was a Hitler girl. Her daughter respected Hitler so much, that it was insane. The girls name was Sophie, and she had a brother named Otto who was in Stalingrad. So basically he came over to the farm house, and Sophie ended up calling my grandma a ‚Äúsubhuman‚Äù. And Otto actually stood up for my grandma, saying, ‚ÄúIf you saw how these, what you mistakenly call, ‚Äúsubhumans‚Äù are fighting us in the east, then you might have a little more respect for their intelligence, bravery, and strength. Sophie‚Äôs eyes widened, and that shut her up for the rest of the evening. <br>So the point of this is to remind you that not all Germans were evil. The axis powers, while the majority still being evil, still fought very bravely and their deaths should still be honored.",16,0

If they had done so, this would have been tantamount to declaring to Belgium (and the Netherlands that they wouldn&#39;t defend them in the event of war with Germany. At a stroke they would have lost those allies before a shot had even been fired. Building the line in Beligium was not an option either, as Belgium wouldn&#39;t have allowed foreign military forces to set up camp en masse in their country. <br>2) The evacuation at Dunkirk wasn&#39;t primarily done by small civilian ships - they played a part, but in reality they rescued a small fraction of the soldiers. <br>3) Even if Germany had achieved air superiority (or even supremacy) over the UK, they wouldn&#39;t have been able to invade - Britain had naval supremacy over Germany (especially after the Norway campaign), and would have wrecked any invasion fleet, regardless of mines and air power.",32,0

Ethiopia didn&#39;t fight with spears either, they still had the same guns they used to whoop Italy&#39;s butt back in 1897!lol The main motive for invading Ethiopia was revenge but the rest of the video was pretty ok.

In junior high we got a rather weird version of the War....always we were taught about the Holocaust, as though WWII was largely about the Holocaust, the same way many people make the Civil War always about freeing the slaves. It was so much more complicated but we got nothing but freeing the slaves and the South fought to keep their free labor and it wasn&#39;t really that as much as economics....as a matter of fact, in California schools, we were taught that white people hated black people so much they enslaved them as a punishment (I am not kidding). I remember that so vividly it was as though we caught Africans because we despised them and because they were black we wanted to buy them from other Africans and brought them home to torture them. I couldn&#39;t follow the logic, but this was when &quot;Roots&quot; was a big hit on TV.... Public schools in blue states are rather strange. It&#39;s as though Hitler mainly fought the war because he wanted nothing but capturing Jews. I guess you could make that argument....",0,1

UgxcQtDH_6YYAdzEf6x4AaABAg,@TheLoneTerran,2021-10-08T09:31:12Z,"Don&#39;t forget that Chamberlain wasn&#39;t a flat out idiot. Chamberlain&#39;s family, mainly at the behest of the daughter, had Chamberlain&#39;s journal stored, hidden, and unopened for a very long time. In his journal, Chamberlain expressed grief knowing that the appeasement plan wasn&#39;t going to actually stop Hitler and it basically threw the smaller nations to the wolves. But neither the UK nor the French had their industries, people, or resources mobilized. Germany could just tell people what to do but the Allies couldn&#39;t do that, aside from their colonies. And the UK and France knew that aid would not becoming from America for a while, so they needed their industries on a war time footing. So appeasement was to buy as many extra days as possible. Pure and simple.<br><br>Every day saw the two countries get a little bit stronger. But the biggest problem was trying to get the citizens ready to accept that war was coming, no matter what. It takes all parties to want peace. The hope was to hunker down behind the Maginot and hold the Italians in the mountains, which the French did with ease. But the French high command hadn&#39;t evolved in 21 years and were crushed.<br><br>Something a lot of people tend to forget is that France&#39;s male population had been gutted. Over 1.4 million dead and over 4.6 million severely wounded. France, in numbers and population percentage were devastated. About 5% of their population were dead or maimed. The French did not want another repeat only two decades later. Who could blame them? We got lucky, we have an ocean separating us from the Germans.<br><br>Chamberlain knew that appeasement wasn&#39;t going to do stop Hitler, but buying time is what the UK and France were aiming for. Bunkering down in France while building up supplies and manpower, the plan was to launch out of France. When French high command lost their best armies and the UK had to abandon all of their heavy equipment at Dunkirk, it was a &quot;darker than our worst nightmares scenario&quot;. Instead of launching FROM France to liberate the nations they&#39;d had to sacrifice to appease to buy time to be able to come back in the first place, no more France.<br><br>To this day, still incorrectly labeled as cowards, because France surrendered. With no organized military force and the enemy outside the capital, you surrender. The French cities were spared what happened in Poland BECAUSE they surrendered. If the French had resisted further, their cities would have received the same. There was no point in causing so much human suffering and risking the loss of centuries of culture. The government did what it had to do to spare the most citizens suffering from destroyed citizens and no food.<br><br>The French people never gave up. The government did because it had too. The French Resistance wasn&#39;t going to expel the Nazis on their own, but they helped. Their preparations saved a lot of lives when after D-Day.<br><br>There is no shame in defeat. Defeat is something every person deals with their entire lives. The shame comes in if after defeat, you quit for good. You may need time to recover, and that&#39;s the smart thing to do, but you come back. The majority of the French government worked to hamper the Nazis. The vast majority of the French population did their best to thwart and murder the Nazis. <br><br>And to top it all off, while all of this is going on, Chamberlain knew he was dying of liver cancer. He knew the that his actions, and the French government&#39;s actions were going to set the course of history for, at least, the next few decades. To have that kind of weight on your shoulders, as you&#39;re dying, had to be nearly unbearable. The world is lucky that the Allies got as long as they did to prepare. If they&#39;d declared war when Hitler took the rest of Czechoslovakia. that would have cost them years of preparation time.<br><br>Chamberlain was not a weak man. Nor was he stupid. You can&#39;t tell the people you&#39;re sacrificing that it&#39;s all for show and you&#39;ll be back in a few years to liberate them. He was in an extremely untenable position, and very, very few people that do not have 80 years of hindsight would have done a whole lot better. He did make mistakes obviously, like the Norway debacle, and maybe he did allow himself hope after having a treaty that would have meant peace in their time. Who wouldn&#39;t? Only a few people throughout history will know how he felt as he saw all their preparations fall apart because of a foolish order to charge instead of waiting in the defensive positions they&#39;d already prepared. To see that not only did war come, but so shortly after a treaty, and the complete surrender of France as well. Very few humans, every, are likely know or understand the depths of despair he felt. His journal after that time, shortly before his death can be hard to read.",1,0

In fact, England only used a third of RAF:s fighters during the battle, those extra planes were a nasty surprise when Winston put them into action during the first huge air raid on London.<br><br>Hitler seriously miscalculated how fast England could build Hurricanes and Spitfires, it turns out that it was far faster then Germany could build bombers.<br><br>Germany lost the battle before it began and Luftwaffe never really came back to the same level afterwards. There is just no scenario where England would loose enough planes for Germany to win, they would have needed 5:1 victories for that and since a large part of the German air fleet was bomber that is just not realistic, great pilots or not.<br><br>Hitler&#39;s idea to bomb London to take Britain out of the war actually had a larger chance of success, if Chamberlain had been in office it might have worked, they might have sued for peace then.<br><br>Luftwaffe&#39;s and RAF&#39;s fighters were pretty similar in performance but since RAF could pick what they attacked they had an advantage. The RAF actually increased their numbers during the length of the battle while Luftwaffe decreased. I know movies and media like to make is so the RAF won by a hair but the actual production numbers Vs losses speak a very different language.<br><br>Churchill were very well aware of how bad the German plans were, that is why he only used a third or his air force, if he used everything the Germans would have stopped the battle after a few days but it was in Churchill&#39;s interest to keep the battle going. He was no fool unlike G√∂ring who severely underestimated British manufacturing capabilities.<br><br>And Luftwaffe could have used those lost planes and pilots later in the war, they were just wasted. Night raids on factories were a different matter but Germany had a problem to reach many of the factories since even the est bombers they had were limited in their range. Germany&#39;s focus on smaller bombers had their drawbacks.",0,0

So the liberation by the US was also a massiv rape. I don&#39;t have the numbers right now but in my memories it&#39;s easily went through 100 000 women raped with many dead among them.

National Socialism could work for Italy where the Global Socialist movement (Communism) had failed. So it wasn&#39;t just nationalism, the rest of Fascist policy included Socialist controls over the economy and society.

Tell the truth history is full of terrible things like THE NAZIS AND HOW THEY STOLE THE SWASTIKA FROM THE INDIAN RELIGION OF JANISM. It used to be a symbol of love and peace but not anymore.

With the personality they give you to do all these things it will be too complicated. Probable acts of violence or discrimination, no work or if there is very hard. High probability of suicide. <br><br>Procedure: there comes a time when suddenly Christ and Satan show up in front of the mirror and by deception force to choose one of the two. By choosing the first, the following things happen: Christ, the Virgin Mary and in case some saints show up and in case you are playing or having fun in any way they force you to work and toil helping someone always with their voice and their words inside your head. Their procedure consists of this: prevent you from having fun, drinking, masturbating, etc. and getting sledding like a mule.     <br>Being as they say second choice, you should only work from morning to night and nothing else. Anything else is not good for them. At first Christ pretends to be God and shows you how he pretends to give you gifts by putting for a moment a kind of white glow at the height of the navel and telling you that they give a &quot;gift&quot; to everyone and no more than one but in reality, they are all lies that as you go on, they come out on their own. They try to frame you with vague promises, rewards and various scum once in what they call &quot;paradise&quot;, but once they verify that the element in question doesn&#39;t take the bait (because he‚Äôs not a moron!) they begin to reveal their infamous procedures that they have implemented to try to ruin his life.  <br>As a second choice you are given a very antisocial, extreme and stray personality so that you cannot have any kind of contact with other people (friendships, relationships) because you see everyone else as if they came from another planet and there is no kind of compatibility. In addition to this your physique is damaged with the following things and for the following reasons: first you will have few or no muscles at all as having been damaged at birth you will be sick and you will have a disposition to make revenge and war against everyone; per second you will have some knee problems that will prevent you from practicing any type of sport in a serious way and third you will have some kind of defect or imperfection in intimate parts such as various spots, in, strange shapes, etc. so as to prevent you from having any kind of relationship.     <br>The second choice should according to their infamous system try to remedy the wrong things that someone who died 40 years ago or more has combined. <br>In paradise a kind of personal &quot;circle&quot; is created where there are the spirits of all the people who have had some kind of importance in your life: family members, sports idols, musicians, actors or characters compatible with your personality or with the life you have to make. All these characters are obliged to show up and say certain phrases with the purpose of deceiving and doing things that the person in question would not do in itself. They also take advantage of the relationship of admiration you had for them when they were alive to get you to have a conversation, but it&#39;s all a lie, the real purpose is to analyze your way of thinking and acting and your personality to see if you can overcome certain obstacles, cheating and lies that will try to get you on the road.    <br>Of all the characters you see the Virgin Mary is the most annoying of all. She talks all the time saying a lot of lies to see if someone is so stupid to believe in it (like their altar boys) and she always and constantly repeats the same things until nausea (procedure). She cries all the time and says she&#39;s the most beautiful woman in the world.     <br>Their way of speaking is to repeat in your head their phrases that irritate and provoke and annoy you to the point of nausea as the angriest you are, the more your nerves jump and the more vulnerable you are to them because you could lose control of your actions and do what they want. They never believe in threats to make them stop until they are put into practice. <br><br>At the beginning of the journey if you rebel against their infamous system, they can resort to making the devil appear.<br>Not having chosen him appears much poorer than he appears to his followers. He can appear in many different forms but usually appears with red eyes and the stick it uses to subdue its followers. Among the things he does to you we find: images of spiders quite credible in the head, temptations of various kinds very treacherous. At first it makes you think he wants to take you into his group by always making you trawls to try to frame yourself (for example women you might have, things that might happen to you, etc.) and then tries to bother you at night by showing you his red eyes, goat legs, strange faces and telling you to come to his group. To try to submit use a kind of feeling of great warmth at the height of the navel that is transmitted throughout the body and that almost gives the feeling of fainting. It is overcome by always being in the company of someone, as it must be stealthy and cannot leave traces. During submission attempts, every thought, everything read and seen, and every memory will be used as a weapon against you.       <br>On some occasions it may go so far as to tell you to give him your soul, that is, to perform the following ritual: to write explicitly your intention on a sheet of paper, to bring blood out of your body and sign with it. As a final act burn the sheet (which is absolutely to be avoided as then you do not go back).     <br>Their followers to get any kind of role in hell must sacrifice everything they have in life and kill someone, better if someone they care about or some complete stranger and as a final gesture themselves. <br>Demons cannot bring anything out and it must be the adept who performs certain rituals to learn new things and improve level, but at each of these acts their lives are ruined more and more.<br>Hell consists of 9 levels. <br>The souls of people who commit suicide are struck by the eyes little by little until they get their eyes ripped, a process that lasts years and they have to turn 15 turns before they can be saved.",0,0

He gets big into socialism, working for trade unions, writing for socialist newspapers, advocating a violent overthrow of European monarchies, the whole shabang. This gets him with a bit of trouble with the swiss police, so he gets arrested, sent back to Italy, set free, returns to Switzerland, is arrested AGAIN, goes back to Italy AGAIN, completes his military service after previously avoiding it, and then after a brief stay as a elementary school teacher, he finally returns to work as a avid socialist. His speeches and journalistic abilities make him famous among Italian socialists. He was anti war, so when Italy colonised Libya in 1910, he rioted, and got arrested. Then WW1 came along, and once again he protested Italy&#39;s involvement, but then he thought, this war could bring about the social climate needed to overthrow European monarchies and bring about the socialist revolution everywhere. And suddenly he was Pro-war. But his fellow socialists didn&#39;t like his pro war stance, so they kicked him out of the party. So then he said: &quot;You know what? I&#39;m done with socialism. We need something new. Not based on class divisions tearing us apart, but based on unity  through nationality. We&#39;ll conquer the Mediterranean, and reunite all Italian peoples just like the days of the roman empire. I will call it FASCISMO (fascism) and it will guide the Italian nation to greatness.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s all well and good, but what type of haircut am I giving you?&quot;",2,0

We are all sinners who have come short of the glory of God. God cannot allow a single sin into Heaven because he is a Holy God. The punishment for sin is Hell, and we are all sinners. God does not want anyone to go to Hell. God loves us so much that he sent his only begotten son to die for our sins. His son, Jesus Christ, took on all of sin when he died on the cross for us. Jesus Christ‚Äôs blood washes away all of our sins. Believe in your heart that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead on the third day. This gift of salvation and eternal life is a free gift of God. By the grace of God, we are saved by faith alone, not of ourselves or our works. <br><br>None of us know when we will die. Accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior and getting saved allows us to have this gift of eternal life in Heaven. Repent. Put your faith in what Jesus Christ did on the cross to save you. Trust in Jesus Christ to save you. Believe in, trust, and have faith in the Gospel, the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br><br>If you are sincere about this, say a prayer to God about it!<br><br>A couple of resources: <br><br>Check out &quot;How to Get Saved&quot; and &quot;The Gospel&quot; by Robert Breaker on YouTube, and check out &quot;How to Get Saved and Be a REAL Bible-Believer&quot; by Gene Kim (REAL Bible Believers) on YouTube.<br><br><br><br>Some verses from the King James Version Bible:<br><br>Romans 3:23<br><br>23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br><br><br><br>2 Corinthians 7:10<br><br>10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.<br><br><br><br>1 Corinthians 15:1-4<br><br>15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;<br><br>2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.<br><br>3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br><br>4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:<br><br><br><br>Romans 10:9-10<br><br>9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<br><br>10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br><br><br>Acts 16:30-31<br><br>30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?<br><br>31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.<br><br><br>Ephesians 2:8-9<br><br>8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br><br>9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br><br><br>Please let me know if this message has helped lead you to Jesus Christ and your salvation.

Charles de Gaulle his man was incredible and was the only one who stood up and fought while P√©tain who was a WWI French war hero had surrendered to Nazi Germany (he wasn&#39;t the pr√©sident but took power after the previous french president immediately resigned). Not only did Charles de Gaulle have to fight against the enemies with the very few thousands of french resistance rebels he racked up (ages around 16-17) with very little military equipment they had to steal  but he also had to fight against France (P√©tain) who outlawed him as a terrorist for trying to save their country! Churchill was the only one who believed in CDG and supported  him while Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) thought he was a dictator since he wasn&#39;t elected (neither was P√©tain but that didn&#39;t seem to bother FDR given that he was most definitely anti semitic as well) and dismissed him as someone important so FDR didn&#39;t want to include him in any discussions while Churchill did want to and tried to convince the stubborn FDR to let him in but failed to. Look him up please. All of France didn&#39;t just drink wine out of their girlfriend&#39;s viginas and eat cheese while Germany was invading.. there were a lot of young brave french men and women who fought for freedom.

You can &quot;not support&quot; someone without being dishonest about them.<br> <br>The original Nazism: Nazism was an ideology in its own right. It was an misunderstanding of socialism, to believe that socialism is about a strong government that works for the people. The nationalist part was referring to the german aspect of it. The party was for the germans and against non germans.<br>The ulterior plan was for the government to confiscate the means of production from the capitalists and make it serve the people.<br> <br>Hitler&#39;s Nazism: Hitler expanded on the german nationalist part. He added the idea of racial hierarchy to it, with the Germans at the top. The so called &quot;Untermensch&quot; was not just racially inferior, but also of less value according to Hitler. He feared a world where Germans hade to serve Jews, Turks, Slavs, Italians and other lower so called &quot;races&quot;.<br>He envisioned a world where he maintained the white &quot;areans&quot; as the rulers of the world and the other ethnicities as the slaves of the white rean race. Then I mean slaves in a very literal sense.<br> <br>Fascism: Fascism is the idea that nations compete for their survival. With nation Mussolini did not mean countries, but ethnicities. A form of social darwinism, but applies to ethnicities... An ethnodarwinism or national darwinism.<br>He thought that the weak nations would fail while the strong one would prevail. This was not something he thought should be the case. He just thought it was the natural order of things.<br>Mussolini then came to rule based on the will to create a strong and unified country immune to other nations whim.<br>There where a few main methods he used to do this...<br>First: He wanted to unify the people under a certain goal. What better way was there than to fight a war. Wars unify people under a common cause. Another thing that was that he clamped down on dissidence, to make the people join under the same ideology. <br>Second: Make the nation independent of other nations. This is why he invaded north Africa, to gain access to oil. He also tried to make the people eat risotto instead of pasta, since Italy hade to import a lot of durum wheat to meat popular demand, while they could produce much more rice domestically.<br>Third: To make the people more macho and less liberal. This was done trough an extensive propaganda campaign. To create a strong people of strong individuals.<br> <br>The fascists wanted to be immune to foreign intervention of any kind. He was the opposite to a globalist.<br>The nazis wanted to become the supreme rulers of this world. They wanted to create a segregated world of ubermensch and slaves to the so called ubermensch.<br>They hated Jews the most because they could hide amongst white Germans without being noticed.

It was called Schwerer Gustav and fired an 800mm-caliber, seven-ton armor-piercing shell. It needed to be set up on twin railroad tracks and had a gun crew of about 500. It was probably built to crack the Maginot line but the French gave up too soon. Maybe as many as three were built, but only one was used for sure, at Sevastopol, a Russian or Ukrainian or Russian (again) city which seems to change hands once or twice each century or so, along with the Crimean peninsula. Hitler wanted to use one on the Poles for ungratefully driving his boys out of Warsaw  for a little while in 1944 (and after he&#39;d already had to take it once before in 1939), but it&#39;s unclear if that actually happened since so many of the potential witnesses became dead soon after, or became very silent about what they were doing and where they were doing it at the time to avoid becoming dead.<br><br>Schwerer Gustav has made some guest appearances.

It is ultimately biased and fundamentally fractured from actual or true fact or a solid unbiased understanding of the complete truth. This is a prime example of how the victor presents a narrative to sway social belief patterning. If all one did was study the unquestioned historical account while adding inadvertent bias statements into the narrative that this video represents then the average percentile will unquestionably align with this limited perspective and be willing to perpetuate the uniformed or incomplete cognitive fact instead of the overall actual, fact or facts. By leaving out decisive details of fact one can manipulate a perspective and breed false cognitive understandings that are not true circumstantial reality: misdirection in place of the actual and true cognitive facts is ignorance and ignorance is not stupidity it amounts to faith and simple belief. These videos should do nothing more than make a good mind asked more questions than they answer. You can tell 9.9% of a story based on actual fact and obtain a highly misinformed percentile belief system willing to reiterate the misconception so long as they don&#39;t gain access to the .1% of the actual fact base.",0,0
